[2025-06-15 12:47:54] - Designed Blog Feature Architecture

## Decision

*   [2025-06-15 10:50:25] - Adopt Next.js with App Router for the new blog application.
*   [2025-06-15 10:50:25] - Core features for MVP: User Auth (Reg/Login), Post CRUD, Post Listing & Viewing, Commenting (Create/View), Categories, Basic User Profiles.
*   [2025-06-15 10:50:25] - Proposed directory structure (see `productContext.md` or initial plan for details).
*   [2025-06-15 10:50:25] - Defined data models for User, Post, Comment with key attributes.
*   The new "blog page" feature will be an extension of the existing "posts" functionality.
*   Dedicated routes under `/blog` for public view and `/admin/blog` for management.
*   Reuse existing `models/Post.ts` for the data model.
*   Authentication via existing auth system; authorization based on `authorId` or admin role for create/edit/delete operations.
*   Defined new file structure for pages, API routes, and UI components, leveraging existing components where adaptable.

## Rationale
*   Leveraging existing "posts" infrastructure minimizes redundancy and development effort.
*   Clear separation of public and admin routes enhances security and user experience.
*   Reusing the `Post` model maintains data consistency.
*   Standard authentication/authorization practices ensure secure access control.

## Implementation Details
*   Refer to [`memory-bank/blog-feature-design.md`](memory-bank/blog-feature-design.md:1) for detailed file paths and component names.
*   API endpoints for modification (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) will be under `/api/admin/blog/...` and will use `[postId]` for robustness.

**Decision:** Corrected `LoginForm` import path in `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`.
**Reason:** User feedback indicated a "Module not found" error due to an incorrect relative path (`'../../../components/auth/LoginForm'`).
**Resolution:** Updated the path to the correct relative path (`'../../../../components/auth/LoginForm'`).
**Affected File:** [`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`](src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx)

**Decision:** Corrected `RegisterForm` import path in `src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`.
**Reason:** User feedback indicated a "Module not found" error due to an incorrect relative path (`'../../../components/auth/RegisterForm'`). This was similar to an earlier issue with the login page.
**Resolution:** Updated the path to the correct relative path (`'../../../../components/auth/RegisterForm'`).
**Affected File:** [`src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`](src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx)
