[2025-06-15 12:47:54] - Designed Blog Feature Architecture

## Decision
*   The new "blog page" feature will be an extension of the existing "posts" functionality.
*   Dedicated routes under `/blog` for public view and `/admin/blog` for management.
*   Reuse existing `models/Post.ts` for the data model.
*   Authentication via existing auth system; authorization based on `authorId` or admin role for create/edit/delete operations.
*   Defined new file structure for pages, API routes, and UI components, leveraging existing components where adaptable.

## Rationale
*   Leveraging existing "posts" infrastructure minimizes redundancy and development effort.
*   Clear separation of public and admin routes enhances security and user experience.
*   Reusing the `Post` model maintains data consistency.
*   Standard authentication/authorization practices ensure secure access control.

## Implementation Details
*   Refer to [`memory-bank/blog-feature-design.md`](memory-bank/blog-feature-design.md:1) for detailed file paths and component names.
*   API endpoints for modification (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) will be under `/api/admin/blog/...` and will use `[postId]` for robustness.
